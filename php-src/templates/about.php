<h2>About</h2>

<p>The design of an <i>intervention logic</i> starts with understanding both the problem 
	to be addressed and the desired outcomes to be achieved, specifying the program logic, 
	and building stakeholder consensus related to this theory of change. The overall objective 
	of this application is to provide an overall representation of the derived outcomes of the 
	Phases 1 – 5, in order for the stakeholders to better understand the rationale behind the 
	RIS3 strategy. </p>

<p>In order to communicate the logic of intervention, the visual representation of the intervention 
	can take various forms. The design should help practitioners understand not only the intended 
	outcomes of an intervention but also the inputs and activities needed to achieve them. 
	We have chosen to design the intervention logic application as a series of blocks, 
	describing the overall strategy flow. Each flowchart corresponds to a specific Investment Priority, 
	and offers the user the opportunity to describe the links between the different building blocks of 
	the intervention logic. These include: context, vision/priorities, policy mix and monitoring. Τhe user 
	can export the results in the form of figures, or print the final intervention logic report produced 
	by this application. 
</p>

<p>The logical steps of the application, based on its methodological description are:</p>

<ul class='dashed'>
    <li><i>Step 1.</i> Description of the regional <strong>context</strong>.</li>
    <li><i>Step 2.</i> Detection of needs and challenges that form the regional <strong>vision</strong>.</li>
    <li><i>Step 3.</i> <strong>Priorities'</strong> specification.</li>
    <li><i>Step 4.</i> Definition of the <strong>actions</strong> and <strong>indicators</strong> to put in place to meet the priorities.</li>
    <li><i>Step 5.</i> <strong>Describe the links</strong> between the building blocks of the intervention logic diagram.</li>
    <li><i>Step 6.</i> <strong>Save</strong> and <strong>export</strong> the final intervention logic report.</li>
</ul>

<p>Following the application architecture described in previous steps, the information flows 
	within the application are given in <strong>Figure 2</strong>, below. Figures including intervention logic diagrams, 
	as well as the description corresponding to each one of them, can be extracted through the application. 
	The main output of the application is the final report of <i>Intervention Logic</i>, which will give the user 
	a comprehensive picture regarding his/her region’s strategic framework.
